# Atmel projects
## MyLibraries
The folder consists of some libraries that I have created for implementing the I2C, ADC, USART, PWM and SPI peripherals of an Atmega8 microcintroller.

## Test examples
ADC test, LCD test, PWM test and UART rx/tx test are testing example codes for the MyLibraries implementations.

## Digital Clock
An LCD digital clock that displays time in 24 hour format.

## Dynamometer
Implementation of dynamometer project with MyLibraries.

## Weather station
Weather station displays the temperature and light intensity sensed through sensors on an LCD display.
