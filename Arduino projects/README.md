# Arduino projects
## Conductive_sensor
Conductive_sensor program establishes I2C communicaation with I/O expander IC MCP23017 to sense the change in water level in a storage tank.

## DeployableSolarArray
Program to control the deployment of a deployable solar array mechanism. For more details please visit the project github repository <a href="https://github.com/SwapUNaph/Deployable-Solar-Array-Controller">project page</a>.


## Dynamometer
Dynamometer senses the rotation speed of an inertial wheel in contact with an automobile tire and stores the rotation speeds in an SD card. These speeds then can be used to calculate the torque and power produced by the automobile at the wheels.

## Home_automation
Home_automation implements the IR remote library to control various electrical appliances with remote.

## LightFollowingRobot
LightFollowingRobot uses two Light Dependent Resisters (LDR) to sense the light intensity and moves the robot towards the light source.

## Self-Balancing Robot
Self-Balancing robot is a robot that balances itself vertically against gravity with the help of gyro sensor readings and PID control algorithm. For more details please visit the project page <a href="https://swapneelnaphade.tech/projects/self-balancing-robot">project page</a>.

## TempDisplay
TempDisplay implements LCD library to display the room temperature with the help of an LM35 temperature sensor.

## WashingMachine
WashingMachine uses a JSON interface to interact with the washing machine system to control the washing and drying time. It essentially converts a traditional washing machine to a smart washing machine with the help of BLuetooth module and a couple of relays.
